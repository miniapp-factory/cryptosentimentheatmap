#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` constants to match the new app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image you want to generate.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create the `logo.png.todo` file.
